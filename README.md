# Procedural-Maze-Generator

An implimentation of Prims algorithm used to generate a maze, containing enemies, treasure, a start point and an end point. The maze is represented by an 3d array of char values, using different charaters to represent each element: * represents a wall, a space represents a path, S represents the start point, E represents the exit point, T represents a treasure spawn, and M represents a monster spawn. The size of the maze is represented by 2 interger values, r and c, refering to rows and columns. Once generated, this maze is outputted to a text file, curMaze.txt.
